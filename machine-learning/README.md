# Machine Learning Models for Wildfire Prediction

This folder contains implementations of traditional machine learning models for wildfire prediction, including RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

## How to Run

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the main script to train the selected model and generate predictions**:
    ```bash
    python train-generate.py
    ```
    You can change the `MODEL_NAME` variable in the `train-generate.py` script to select the model you want to run.
