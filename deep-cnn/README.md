# Deep CNN for Wildfire Prediction

This folder contains the implementation of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for wildfire prediction.

## How to Run

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the main script to train the model and generate predictions**:
    ```bash
    python deep-cnn.py
    ```
