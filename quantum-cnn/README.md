# Quantum CNN for Wildfire Prediction

This folder contains an experimental model that uses a quantum convolutional neural network (QuantumCNN) for wildfire prediction.

## How to Run

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the main script to train the model and generate predictions**:
    ```bash
    python quantum.py
    ```
